It is annotated with Java Persistence Annotations for database mapping and validation constraints.```java@Entity@Table(name= "OYO")public class Room {    @Id    private Integer roomId;    private Integer roomNumber;    private Type roomType;    @Column(name = "available")    private boolean roomAvailable;    private double roomPrice;}```### EnumerationAn enumeration `Type` is used to specify room types (AC, NON_AC).```javapublic enum Type {    AC,    NON_AC}```### Repository InterfacesTwo repository interfaces are defined for the `Room` entity: `IRoomRepo`. They extend `CrudRepository` for easy database operations.```java@Repositorypublic interface IRoomRepo extends CrudRepository<Room, Integer> {}```### Service ClassesThe application includes a service class `RoomService` that provides business logic for room-related operations.```java@Servicepublic class RoomService {    @Autowired    IRoomRepo roomRepo;    public String addRoom(Room newRoom) {        roomRepo.save(newRoom);        return "room added";    }    public List<Room> getRooms() {        return (List<Room>) roomRepo.findAll();    }}```### Controller ClassA controller class `RoomController` defines API endpoints to interact with the application:```java@RestControllerpublic class RoomController {    @Autowired    RoomService roomService;    @PostMapping("room")    public String addRoom(@RequestBody Room newRoom) {        return roomService.addRoom(newRoom);    }    @GetMapping("rooms")    public List<Room> getRooms() {        return roomService.getRooms();    }}```### Application Entry PointThe application is initiated through the main class `RoomAppApplication`. It uses Spring Boot to run the application.```java@SpringBootApplicationpublic class RoomAppApplication {    public static void main(String[] args) {        SpringApplication.run(RoomAppApplication.class, args);    }}```## Project SummaryThe Room Booking Application is built using Spring Boot with an H2 database. It manages room booking data efficiently by following a structured data flow pattern. Room details are represented by the `Room` entity, and CRUD operations are provided through API endpoints. The application can be extended as needed to add more features and functionality.---
